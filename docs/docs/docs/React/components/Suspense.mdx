`Suspense` lets you show a fallback UI (like a loading spinner) while waiting for lazy-loaded components to load.

Suspense is useful for code-splitting and lazy-loading components, providing a better user experience while waiting for content to load.

```fsharp
[<ReactComponent(true)>]
let SuspenseDemo() =
    Html.div [
        React.suspense(
            [ 
              // children
            ],
            Html.div [ prop.text "fallback" ]
        )
    ]
```

import SuspenseDemo from '../../../feliz-docs/fableoutput/Examples/React/Suspense'
import RawSuspenseDemo from '!!raw-loader!../../../feliz-docs/Examples/React/Suspense.fs'

<ComponentRender code={RawSuspenseDemo}>
  <SuspenseDemo />
</ComponentRender>
