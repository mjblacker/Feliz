`useReducer` lets you manage complex state logic in your components using a reducer function, similar to Redux/[Elmish](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/).

This hook is useful for managing state transitions that depend on previous state, or when state logic is too complex for `useState`.

The example is very simple and just demonstrates the basic usage of `useReducer`. 

```fsharp
type State = { Count : int }

type Msg = Increment | Decrement

let initialState = { Count = 0 }

let update (state: State) = function
    | Increment -> { state with Count = state.Count + 1 }
    | Decrement -> { state with Count = state.Count - 1 }

[<ReactComponent(true)>]
let UseReducer() =
    let (state, dispatch) = React.useReducer(update, initialState)
    Html.div [
        Html.p [ prop.text $"Count: {state.Count}" ]
        Html.button [
            prop.text "+"
            prop.onClick (fun _ -> dispatch Increment)
        ]
        Html.button [
            prop.text "-"
            prop.onClick (fun _ -> dispatch Decrement)
        ]
        Html.p [ prop.text "useReducer is useful for complex state logic." ]
    ]
```
