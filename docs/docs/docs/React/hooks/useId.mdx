`useId` generates a unique ID. This can be used for accessibility and associating elements, such as labels and inputs, in your components.

`useId` helps ensure that IDs are unique across server and client renders, which is important for accessibility and forms. It is especially useful when rendering multiple components that need unique IDs.

```fsharp
[<ReactComponent(true)>]
let UseId() =
    let id = React.useId()
    // ... use the id in your component
```

import UseId from '../../../feliz-docs/fableoutput/Examples/React/UseId'
import RawUseId from '!!raw-loader!../../../feliz-docs/Examples/React/UseId.fs'

<ComponentRender code={RawUseId}>
  <UseId />
</ComponentRender>
