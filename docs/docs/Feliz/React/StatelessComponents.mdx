# Stateless Components
The simplest types of React components are those that are stateless: they don't internal have state and don't have any side-effects.

### Defining React Components
To define a component, use the `[<ReactComponent>]` attribute on top of a function that returns `ReactElement`. React components built with have to defined at a *module-level* (i.e. not inside another function).


import ComponentRender from '@site/src/components/ComponentRender';
import RawGreeting from '!!raw-loader!../../feliz-docs/Examples/React/Greeting.fs'
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

<CodeBlock language="fsharp">
{RawGreeting}
</CodeBlock>

### Using React components

Once you have defined a component like we did with `greeting` above, you can use it as a function of type `'props -> ReactElement` and combine with other components like any other UI element:


import Greetings from '../../feliz-docs/fableoutput/Examples/React/Greetings'
import RawGreetings from '!!raw-loader!../../feliz-docs/Examples/React/Greetings.fs'

<ComponentRender code={RawGreetings}> 
  <Greetings />
</ComponentRender>


### Components As Static Functions

React components can also be defined as static members of a static class. The benefit of this approach is that you use _named_ parameters at call-site or implicitly optional parameters in the definition:

```fsharp
open Feliz

type Components() =
    [<ReactComponent>]
    static member Greeting(name: string, age: int) =
        Html.div [
            Html.span $"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old"
        ]

Html.div [
    prop.className "content"
    prop.children [
        // call-site is more readable because of the named parameters
        Components.Greeting(name="Jane", age=20)
        Components.Greeting(name="John", age=25)
    ]
]
```
