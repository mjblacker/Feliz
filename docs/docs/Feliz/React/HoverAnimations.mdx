# Hover Animations

You can use React components to implement hover animations for elements without writing any CSS. This is done by keeping track of a hover state flag and toggling it on or off when the mouse enters or leaves the elements. Here is an example:

import ComponentRender from '@site/src/components/ComponentRender';
import HoverAnimations from '../../feliz-docs/fableoutput/Examples/React/HoverAnimations'
import RawHoverAnimations from '!!raw-loader!../../feliz-docs/Examples/React/HoverAnimations.fs'

<ComponentRender code={RawHoverAnimations}> 
  <HoverAnimations />
</ComponentRender>
