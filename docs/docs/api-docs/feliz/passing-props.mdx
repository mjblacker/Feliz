In Feliz you can pass props to components in a similar way as you would in React with JSX. Props are simply function parameters that you define in your component function.

## Example

<ComponentRender code={RawExample} defaultOpen>
  <Example />
</ComponentRender>

## Passing Children

In JSX syntax you typically pass children between the opening and closing tags of a component. 

```JSX
<MyButton onClick={handleClick}>
    Click Me
</MyButton>
```

This behavior is mimicked in Feliz by defining a `children` parameter in your component function. You can then pass the children as an argument when calling the component.

```fsharp
[<ReactComponent(true)>]
let MyButton(children: ReactElement, onClick: unit -> unit, props: IReactProperty list) =
    Html.button [
        prop.style [
            style.padding 10
            style.backgroundColor.lightBlue
            style.borderRadius 5
            style.cursor.pointer
        ]
        prop.onClick (fun _ -> onClick())
        yield! props // same as `...props` in JSX. Can overwrite existing props
        prop.children children
    ]
```


## Spreading props

You can also spread additional props using the `yield!` syntax inside the `prop` list. This allows you to pass any number of additional properties to the component, similar to the spread operator (`...props`) in JSX. Be aware that spreading props can overwrite existing props if there are conflicts.

::::info

When using prop spreading, be cautious as it can lead to unintended overwrites of existing props, which may cause unexpected behavior in your components.

In a list of properties, the last occurrence of a property takes precedence. Therefore, if you spread props after defining specific properties, the spread props can overwrite those specific properties.

:::danger
The exception to this rule is the `children` property. For children the first occurrence takes precedence.

:::tip
It is recommended to define most arguments explicitly for better type safety and clarity. Use spreading only when necessary.

        yield! props // same as `...props` in JSX. Can overwrite existing props
    ]
```
