F# syntax allows for multiple solutions to conditional rendering in React components. Here are some of the most common patterns:

:::info

You can use any F# pattern normally used for conditional logic in your React components.

:::


import ConditionalRendering from '../../feliz-docs/fableoutput/Examples/Feliz/ConditionalRendering'
import RawConditionalRendering from '!!raw-loader!../../feliz-docs/Examples/Feliz/ConditionalRendering.fs'

<ComponentRender code={RawConditionalRendering} defaultOpen>
  <ConditionalRendering />
</ComponentRender>

## if ... else

The classic `if ... else` expression can be used to conditionally include elements in the render output. Inside lists you can omit the `else` case if you don't want to do anything in that case. If you have multiple if ... else cases you can use `elif` to chain them together.

```fsharp
Html.div [
    Html.text text
    if not isMany then Html.text " ⚠️" // inside a list `else` case can be omitted
] 

// in this case we cannot omit `else` case
let className = if isMany then "text-green-500" else "text-red-500"
// but we can also use the expression directly 
prop.className [
    if isMany then "text-green-500" else "text-red-500"
]

if count > 5 then
  "Many"
elif count > 10 then
  "A lot"
else
  "Few"
```

## Pattern matching

Pattern matching is a powerful feature of F# that can be used for conditional rendering. It allows you to match against specific values or patterns and render different elements based on the match.

It provides a clean and expressive way to handle multiple conditions, while at the same time allowing for deconstruction logic on some types (like `option`, `list`, `tuple`, and discriminated unions).

```fsharp

match (Some 5) with // option
| Some count -> Html.div [ Html.textf "%d left in store" count ]
| None -> Html.div [ Html.text "Out of stock" ]

type Person = { Name: string option; IsSignedIn: bool }

match { Name = Some "Alice"; IsSignedIn = true } with // record type
| { IsSignedIn = true; Name = name } -> Html.div [ Html.textf "Welcome back, %s!" name ]
| { IsSignedIn = false } -> Html.div [ Html.textf "Hello, please sign in." ]

match [1; 2; 3] with // list
| [] -> Html.div [ Html.text "Empty list" ]
| [x] -> Html.div [ Html.textf "Single item: %d" x ]
| [x; y] -> Html.div [ Html.textf "Two items: %d and %d" x y ]
| x :: xs -> Html.div [ Html.textf "Head: %d, Tail length: %d" x (List.length xs) ]

```
