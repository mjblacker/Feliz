[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it fast to build custom designs without leaving your HTML/JSX/Feliz code. Instead of writing new CSS for each component you compose styles by combining small, single-purpose utility classes.

## Why use Tailwind?
- Rapid development: compose UI quickly with utility classes instead of creating new CSS for every component.
- Small, maintainable stylesheet surface: unused utilities are purged in production so the final bundle stays small.
- Highly customizable: theme tokens, variants and plugins make it easy to adapt to your design system.
- Works great with modern toolchains like Vite and Fable (Feliz projects).

:::info
Because interop with tailwind and F# is so quick and easy the [Feliz template](../../api-docs/GettingStarted.mdx#template-nuget) also comes with tailwindcss preconfigured. You can get started with tailwindcss right away when creating a new Feliz project using the template.

## VS Code Extension

You can easily configure the [tailwindcss VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) to provide autocomplete and intellisense features for F# files. Check out the autocomplete and intellisense features from the image below!

:::note[YOUR HELP NEEDED ❤️]
If anyone is using a different editor and knows how to set this up there, please(!) let me know!

You just need to add the following to your VS Code settings.json:

```json title="./vscode/settings.json"
{
    "tailwindCSS.includeLanguages": {
        "fsharp": "html"
    },
    "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
        "\\.className\\s+\"([^\"]*)\"",
        ["\\.className\\s+\\[([^\\]]*)\\]", "\"([^\"]*)\""]
    ],
}
```

This allows you to use the full tool chain without any maintenance overhead!

## DaisyUI

For common components and prebuilt design patterns, consider using [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). It is a actively maintained and very user friendly library for styled components. Using the code extension above, you will also get autocomplete and intellisense for DaisyUI classes in your F# files!
