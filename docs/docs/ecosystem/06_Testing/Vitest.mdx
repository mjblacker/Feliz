Vitest integrates well with the vite bundler and provides a fast and reliable testing framework for unit as well as component tests. There are even options to integrate Vitest with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/integrations/vitest-addon).

The bindings for the Vitest ecosystem are developed and maintained by the [Fable Hub](https://github.com/fable-hub/Feliz) and used for testing in the Feliz project.

:::info
The [Feliz template](../../api-docs/GettingStarted.mdx#template-nuget) also ships with Vitest preconfigured. You can get started with Vitest right away when creating a new Feliz project using the template.

        let first = RTL.screen.getByTestId "first"
        let second = RTL.screen.getByTestId "second"

        expect(first).toHaveTextContent "Hello"
