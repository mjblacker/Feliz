VS Code is a popular, lightweight code editor developed by Microsoft. It has excellent support for F# development through the Ionide extension. It also supports a wide range of extensions useful for web development with Feliz.

Download VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download/).

:::info[Recommended Extensions]

You can add a list of recommended extensions for your project by creating a `.vscode/extensions.json` file in your project folder. This will trigger a prompt in VS Code suggesting to install the recommended extensions when the project is opened.

```json title=".vscode/extensions.json"
{
    // See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=827846 to learn about workspace recommendations.

## Features

### Ionide

Full Support for F# and .NET. Without this it does not make sense to use VS Code for F# development 😉.

Install the [Ionide extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp) from the VS Code marketplace to get started.

#### Fantomas

Fantomas is part of the Ionide extensions and can be used to format your F# code. this helps readability and maintainability of your codebase, while giving you peace of mind that your code is consistently formatted.

With VS Code you can easily **run Fantomas on save**, so your code is always formatted when you save a file. This can even be pushed to source control to share this setting with your team.

```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
{
    "[fsharp]": {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "Ionide.Ionide-fsharp"
    }
}
```

### Tailwind CSS Support

The official tailwindCSS extension can be configured to provide IntelliSense support for Tailwind CSS classes used in Feliz applications.

2. Add the following configuration to your `.vscode/settings.json` file to enable support for F# files:

```json title=".vscode/settings.json" 
{
    "tailwindCSS.includeLanguages": {
        "fsharp": "html"
    },
    "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
        "\\.className\\s+\"([^\"]*)\"",
        ["\\.className\\s+\\[([^\\]]*)\\]", "\"([^\"]*)\""]
    ]
}
```
