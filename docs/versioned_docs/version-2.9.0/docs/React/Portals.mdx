# Portals

Portals provide a way to render components outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. Portals are often used to create dialog components in React applications.

You can create a portal component by calling the function `ReactDOM.createPortal : ReactElement -> HTMLElement -> ReactElement`.

A common use case is to render a component as direct child to `document.body` or some other DOM element that is not a direct parent of the component. This is useful for modals, tooltips, and other UI elements that need to escape the normal flow of the document.



import ComponentRender from '@site/src/components/ComponentRender';
import Portal from '../../feliz-docs/fableoutput/Examples/React/Portal'
import RawPortal from '!!raw-loader!../../feliz-docs/Examples/React/Portal.fs'

Here we create a reusable reusable component `Portal` to render a child component into the `document.body`.

<ComponentRender code={RawPortal} triggerRender> 
  <Portal />
</ComponentRender>
